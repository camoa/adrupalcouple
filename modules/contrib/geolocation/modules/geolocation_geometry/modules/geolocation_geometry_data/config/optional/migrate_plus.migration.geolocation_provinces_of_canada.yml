# A "migration" is, in technical terms, a plugin whose configuration describes
# how to read source data, process it (generally by mapping source fields to
# destination fields), and write it to Drupal.

# The machine name for a migration, used to uniquely identify it.

# Every migration must also have a destination plugin, which handles writing
# the migrated data in the appropriate form for that particular kind of data.
# Most Drupal content is an "entity" of one type or another, and we need to
# specify what entity type we are populating (in this case, taxonomy terms).
# Unlike the source plugin (which is specific to our particular scenario), this
# destination plugin is implemented in Drupal itself.
destination:
  plugin: entity:taxonomy_term

# Here's the meat of the migration - the processing pipeline. This describes how
# each destination field is to be populated based on the source data. For each
# destination field, one or more process plugins may be invoked.
process:
  # The simplest process plugin is named 'get' - it is the default plugin, so
  # does not need to be explicitly named. It simply copies the source value
  # (the 'style' field from the source database in this case) to the destination
  # field (the taxonomy term 'name' field). You can see we simply copy the
  # source 'details' field to destination 'description' field in the same way.

  field_geometry_data_geometry: geojson

  # Here is a new plugin - default_value. In its simplest usage here, it is used
  # to hard-code a destination value, the vid (vocabulary ID) our taxonomy terms
  # should be assigned to. It's important to note that while above the right
  # side of the mappings was a source field name, here the right side of the
  # 'default_value:' line is an actual value.
